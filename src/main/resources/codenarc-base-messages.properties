ReturnFromFinallyBlock.description=Returning from a <em>finally</em> block is confusing and can hide the original exception.
StringInstantiation.description=Use a String literal (e.g., "...") instead of calling the corresponding String constructor (new String("..")) directly.
ThrowExceptionFromFinallyBlock.description=Throwing an exception from a <em>finally</em> block is confusing and can hide the original exception.
EmptyCatchBlock.description=In most cases, exceptions should not be caught and ignored (swallowed).
EmptyTryBlock.description=Empty <em>try</em> blocks are confusing and serve no purpose.
EmptyFinallyBlock.description=Empty <em>finally</em> blocks are confusing and serve no purpose.
EmptyIfStatement.description=Empty <em>if</em> statements are confusing and serve no purpose.
EmptyElseBlock.description=Empty <em>else</em> blocks are confusing and serve no purpose.
EmptyForStatement.description=Empty <em>for</em> statements are confusing and serve no purpose.
EmptyWhileStatement.description=Empty <em>while</em> statements are confusing and serve no purpose.

# BRACES
IfStatementBraces.description=Use braces for <em>if</em> statements, even for a single statement.
WhileStatementBraces.description=Use braces for <em>while</em> statements, even for a single statement.
ElseBlockBraces.description=Use braces for <em>else</em> blocks, even for a single statement. By default, braces are not required for an <em>else</em> if it is followed immediately by an <em>if</em>. Set the <em>bracesRequiredForElseIf</em> property to true to require braces is that situation as well. 
ForStatementBraces.description=Use braces for <em>for</em> statements, even for a single statement.

# EXCEPTIONS
CatchThrowable.description=Catching <em>Throwable</em> is dangerous; it can catch exceptions such as <em>ThreadDeath</em> and <em>OutOfMemoryError</em>.

# GENERIC
IllegalRegex.description=Checks for a specified illegal regular expression within the source code. The <em>regex</em> property specifies the regular expression to check for. It is required and cannot be null or empty.
RequiredRegex.description=Checks for a specified regular expression that must exist within the source code. The <em>regex</em> property specifies the regular expression to check for. It is required and cannot be null or empty.

# IMPORTS
DuplicateImport.description=Duplicate import statements are unnecessary.
ImportFromSamePackage.description=An import of a class that is within the same package is unnecessary.
UnnecessaryGroovyImport.description=A Groovy file does not need to include an import for classes from <em>java.lang</em>, <em>java.util</em>, <em>java.io</em>, <em>java.net</em>, <em>groovy.lang</em> and <em>groovy.util</em>, as well as the classes <em>java.math.BigDecimal</em> and <em>java.math.BigInteger</em>.
UnusedImport.description=Imports for a class that is never referenced within the source file is unnecessary.

# NAMING
AbstractClassName.description=Verifies that the name of an abstract class mathes a regular expression. By default it checks that the abstract class name starts with the 'Abstract' prefix, followed by an uppercase letter and then zero or more word characters (letters, numbers or underscores). The <em>regex</em> property specifies the regular expression used to validate the abstract class name.
ClassName.description=Verifies that the name of a class mathes a regular expression. By default it checks that the class name starts with an uppercase letter and is followed by zero or more word characters (letters, numbers or underscores). The <em>regex</em> property specifies the regular expression used to validate the class name.
FieldName.description=Verifies that the name of each field matches a regular expression. By default it checks that non-'final' field names start with a lowercase letter and contains only letters or numbers, and 'final' field names start with an uppercase letter and contain only uppercase letters, numbers and underscores. The <em>regex</em> property specifies the default regular expression used to validate field names. The <em>finalRegex</em> property specifies the regular expression to validate 'final' field names. The <em>staticRegex</em> property specifies the regular expression to validate 'static' field names. The <em>staticFinalRegex</em> property specifies the regular expression to validate 'static final' field names.
PackageName.description=Verifies that the package name for a class matches a regular expression. By default it checks that the package name consists of only lowercase letters, separated by periods. The <em>regex</em> property specifies the regular expression used to validate the package name. The <em>packageNameRequired</em> property indicates whether a package name declaration is required for all classes.
MethodName.description=Verifies that the name of each method matches a regular expression. By default it checks that the method name starts with a lowercase letter. The <em>regex</em> property specifies the regular expression to check the method name against.
VariableName.description=Verifies that the name of each method matches a regular expression. By default it checks that non-'final' variable names start with a lowercase letter and contains only letters or numbers, and 'final' variable names start with an uppercase letter and contain only uppercase letters, numbers and underscores. The <em>regex</em> property specifies the default regular expression used to validate a non-'final' variable name. The <em>finalRegex</em> property specifies the regular expression used to validate 'final' variable names.

# SIZE
ClassSize.description=Checks if the size of a class exceeds the number of lines specified by the <em>maxLines</em> property, which defaults to 1000.
MethodSize.description=Checks if the size of a method exceeds the number of lines specified by the <em>maxLines</em> property, which defaults to 100.
