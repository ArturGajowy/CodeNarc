Imports Rules  ("<rulesets/imports.xml>")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* DuplicateImport Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Checks for a duplicate <import> statements.

  <<NOTE:>> Does not work on <Groovy 1.7.x> (i.e., will not find violations).

  <<NOTE:>> Does not distinguish between multiple duplicate imports of the same class.
  Thus, it may produce multiple violations with the same line number in that case. 


* ImportFromSamePackage Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Checks for an <import> of a class that is within the same package as the importing class.


* UnnecessaryGroovyImport Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Checks for an <import> from any package that is already automatically imported for
  Groovy files. A Groovy file does not need to include an import for classes from
  <java.lang>, <java.util>, <java.io>, <java.net>, <groovy.lang> and <groovy.util>, as well as the
  classes <java.math.BigDecimal> and <java.math.BigInteger>.


* UnusedImport Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Checks for <import> statements for classes that are never referenced within the source file. Also
  checks static imports.

  Known limitations:

  * Does not check for unused imports containing wildcards (e.g. <<<import org.codenarc.*>>>)

  * Misses unused imports if the class/alias name is contained within strings, comments or other (longer)
    names (i.e., if that string shows up almost anywhere within the source code).
