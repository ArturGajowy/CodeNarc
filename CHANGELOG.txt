CodeNarc Change Log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.codenarc.org

Changes in version 0.13 (February 2011)
-------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES
- Better support for command line runners. You can now specify the report type "console" as a command line parameter,
  and the CodeNarc text report is output to the console instead of a file. Feature #3162487
- All rules now provide a nicely formatted message. This makes console tools and the CodeNarc Web Console much more
  user friendly. Feature #3162847

NEW RULES
- ExceptionExtendsError rule (exceptions) - Feature #3161749 - Errors are system exceptions. Do not extend them.
- AvoidThreadGroup rule (concurrency) - Feature #3161692 - Avoid using ThreadGroup; although it is intended to be used in a threaded environment it contains methods that are not thread safe.
- SerializableClassMustDefineSerialVersionUID rule (basic) - Feature #3161076 - Classes that implement Serializable should define a serialVersionUID.
- EmptyStaticInitializer rule (basic) - Feature #3161685 - An empty static initializer was found. It is safe to remove it.
- EmptyInstanceInitializer rule (basic) - Feature #3163464 - An empty instance initializer. It is safe to remove it.
- EmptyMethod rule (basic) - Feature #3163806 - A method was found without an implementation. If the method is overriding or implementing a parent method, then mark it with the @Override annotation.
- ConsecutiveStringConcatenation rule (basic) - Feature #3163826 - Catches concatenation of two string literals on the same line. These can safely by joined.
- ConsecutiveLiteralAppends rule (basic) - Feature #3161779 - Violations occur when method calls to append(Object) are chained together with literals as parameters. The chained calls can be joined into one invocation.
- AddEmptyString rule (basic) - Feature #3161763 - Finds empty string literals which are being added. This is an inefficient way to convert any type to a String.
- UnnecessaryModOne rule (unnecessary) - Feature #3164684 - Any expression mod 1 (exp % 1) is guaranteed to always return zero. This code is probably an error, and should be either (exp & 1) or (exp % 2).
- StaticCalendarField rule (concurrency) - Feature #3164702 - Calendar objects should not be used as static fields. Calendars are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application.
- StaticDateFormatField rule (concurrency) - DateFormat objects should not be used as static fields. DateFormat are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application.
- BrokenOddnessCheck rule (basic) - Feature #3164687 - The code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work for negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check for oddness, consider using x & 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0.
- MissingNewInThrowStatementRule (exceptions) - Feature #3166115 - Improved existing rule to catch throwing a class literal, which always causes a RuntimeException.
- UnnecessaryCallToSubstring rule (unnecessary) - Feature #3164688 - Calling String.substring(0) always returns the original string. This code is meaningless.


BUG FIXES
- Fix Bug #3162499 UnnecessaryObjectReferences: This rule was not ignoring 'this' references, leading to false positives. 
- Fix Bug #3164150 UnnecessaryReturnKeyword: Rule is no longer triggered if the return is for a closure.
- Fix Bug #3165139 LoggingSwallowsStacktrace: No longer reports multiple logger errors.

POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES
- addViolation(ASTNode) is deprecated. Instead use addViolation(ASTNode, String) when adding violations to the output.

POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES
- Moved the existing StringInstantiation and BooleanInstantiation rules from the Basic ruleset into the Unnecessary ruleset.
  Also renamed the rules to UnnecessaryStringInstantiationRule and UnnecessaryBooleanInstantiation).
  Likewise, the rule classes were moved from the org.codenarc.rule.basic package into org.codenarc.rule.unnecessary.
  NOTE: This should only affect users if
    * You configured one of these rules specifically by rule name or by class name within a custom ruleset
    * You configured one of these rules (by rule name) within "codenarc.properties"
    * You configured one of these rules (by rule name) within a @SuppressWarnings annotation
    * You configured one of these rules (by rule name) within "codenarc-message.properties".
- Removed deprecated applyToFilenames and doNotApplyToFilenames properties of AbstractRule.

OTHER CHANGES
- UnnecessaryIfStatementRule: Expand the rule to also catch if/else statements that contain only single constant/literal expressions for the if and/or else blocks, if the if is not the last statement in the block.
- Feature #3108153: Expand ReturnNull* rules to catch elvis operators
- Feature #3111442: "add better error messages to the ReturnsNull*Rules"
- Feature #3111440: "added better violation messages to BigDecimalInstantiationRule, BooleanInstantiationRule, and StringInstantiationRule".
- Add isValid() to SourceCode (and AbstractSourceCode).


Changes in version 0.11 (November 2010)
-------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES
- @SuppressWarnings support. All rules now recognize the java.lang.SuppressWarnings annotation on fields, methods, and classes. If this annotation is added then there will be no violations produced. Just as in Java, the annotation requires a String or List<String> parameter. For example, annotating a class with @SuppressWarnings('UnusedPrivateField') will ignore the rule for that class. Annotating a method with @SuppressWarnings(['UnusedPrivateField', 'UnnecessaryIfStatementRule']) will ignore both rules for the annotated method. 
- Better "codenarc create-rule" support. You can create a new rule by running "codenarc create-rule" from the root of the CodeNarc codebase. This script has been updated to properly format Javadoc, prompt for the author name, and update the Maven Site .apt documentation. 

NEW RULES
BooleanMethodReturnsNull Rule (basic) : Checks for a method with Boolean return type that returns an explicit null. 
DeadCode Rule (basic) :  Checks for dead code that appears after a return statement or after an exception is thrown. 
DoubleNegative Rule (basic) :  Checks for using a double negative, which is always positive. 
DuplicateCaseStatement Rule (basic) :  Check for duplicate case statements in a switch block, such as two equal integers or strings. 
ExplicitCallToAndMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the and(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the & operator. 
ExplicitCallToCompareToMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the compareTo(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the <=>, >, >=, <, and <= operators. 
ExplicitCallToDivMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the div(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the / operator.
ExplicitCallToEqualsMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the equals(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the == or != operator. 
ExplicitCallToGetAtMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the getAt(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the [] index operator. 
ExplicitCallToLeftShiftMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the leftShift(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the \<\< operator. 
ExplicitCallToMinusMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the minus(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the - operator. 
ExplicitCallToMultiplyMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the multiply(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the * operator. 
ExplicitCallToModMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the mod(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the % operator. 
ExplicitCallToOrMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the or(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the | operator. 
ExplicitCallToPlusMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the plus(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the + operator.

ExplicitCallToXorMethod Rule (basic) :  This rule detects when the xor(Object) method is called directly in code instead of using the ^ operator. 
ExplicitArrayListInstantiation Rule (basic) :  This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of an ArrayList. In Groovy, it is best to write new ArrayList() as [], which creates the same object.
ExplicitHashMapInstantiation Rule (basic) :  This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of a HashMap. In Groovy, it is best to write new HashMap() as [:], which creates the same object.
ExplicitHashSetInstantiation Rule (basic) :  This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of a HashSet. In Groovy, it is best to write new HashSet() as [] as Set, which creates the same object.
ExplicitLinkedListInstantiation Rule (basic) :  This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of a LinkedList. In Groovy, it is best to write new LinkedList() as [] as Queue, which creates the same object.
ExplicitStackInstantiation Rule (basic) :  This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of a Stack. In Groovy, it is best to write new Stack() as [] as Stack, which creates the same object.
ExplicitTreeSetInstantiation Rule (basic) :  This rule checks for the explicit instantiation of a TreeSet. In Groovy, it is best to write new TreeSet()>> as [] as SortedSet, which creates the same object. 
GStringAsMapKey Rule  A GString should not be used as a map key since its hashcode is not guaranteed to be stable. 
InvertedIfElse Rule (basic) :  An inverted if-else statement is one in which there is a single if statement with a single else branch and the boolean test of the if is negated. 
RemoveAllOnSelf Rule (basic) : Don't use removeAll to clear a collection. 
ReturnsNullInsteadOfEmptyArray Rule (basic) : If you have a method or closure that returns an array, then when there are no results return a zero-length (empty) array rather than null. 
ReturnsNullInsteadOfEmptyCollection Rule (basic) : If you have a method or closure that returns a collection, then when there are no results return a zero-length (empty) collection rather than null. 
SerialVersionUID Rule (basic) : A serialVersionUID is normally intended to be used with Serialization. It needs to be of type long, static, and final. 
UnnecessaryConstructor Rule (unnecessary) : This rule detects when a constructor is not necessary; i.e., when there's only one constructor, it's public, has an empty body, and takes no arguments.
UnnecessaryCollectionCall Rule (unnecessary) : Checks for useless calls to collections.
UnnecessaryOverridingMethod Rule (unnecessary) : Checks for an overriding method that merely calls the same method defined in a superclass.
UnnecessaryReturnKeyword Rule (unnecessary) :  In Groovy, the return keyword is often optional.
SynchronizedOnGetClass Rule (concurrency) : Checks for synchronization on getClass() rather than class literal. 
UseOfNotifyMethod Rule (concurrency) : Checks for code that calls notify() rather than notifyAll(). 
DuplicateNumberLiteral Rule (dry) : This rule checks for duplicate number literals within the current class.

ConfusingClassNamedException Rule (exceptions) : This class is not derived from another exception, but ends with 'Exception'. 
ReturnNullFromCatchBlock Rule (exceptions) : Returning null from a catch block often masks errors and requires the client to handle error codes. 
UseAssertEqualsInsteadOfAssertTrue Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit assertions in object equality. 
UseAssertTrueInsteadOfAssertEqualsRule Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling assertEquals where the first parameter is a boolean. 
UseAssertNullInsteadOfAssertEquals Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling assertEquals where the first or second parameter is null. 
UseAssertSameInsteadOfAssertTrue Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling assertTrue or assertFalse where the first or second parameter is an Object#is() call testing for reference equality. 
JUnitFailWithoutMessage Rule (junit) : This rule detects JUnit calling the fail() method without an argument. 
JUnitStyleAssertions Rule (junit) : This rule detects calling JUnit style assertions like assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertNull, assertNotNull.
ConfusingMethodName Rule (naming) : Checks for very confusing method names. The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization.
ObjectOverrideMisspelledMethodName Rule (naming) : Verifies that the names of the most commonly overridden methods of Object: equals, hashCode and toString, are correct.
MethodCount Rule (size) : Checks if the number of methods within a class exceeds the number of lines specified by the maxMethod property.

BUG FIXES
- None reported, none fixed! 

POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES
- AbstractAstVisitor - If you implemented your own rule by subclassing AbstractAstVisitor then your code might break. It is a compile error and the breakage will be clear and obvious. In order to support @SuppressWarnings, we needed to change AbstractAstVisitor. The method visitMethodNode became visitMethodNodeEx, visitClass became visitClassEx, visitConstructorOrMethod became visitConstructorOrMethodEx, visitField became visitFieldEx, visitProperty became visitPropertyEx, and visitConstructor became visitConstructorEx. From within these new methods there is no need to call super.visitX. In the rare case that the simple renaming does not fix your problem then please contact the mailing list.
- The following three classes were moved from the org.codenarc.rule.basic package into org.codenarc.rule.unnecessary.
  Likewise, the associated rules were moved from the "basic" ruleset into the new "unnecessary" ruleset.
  You will need to adjust your ruleset configuration if you included one of these rules specifically in a custom ruleset, or configured them as part of the "basic" ruleset. 
    * UnnecessaryBooleanExpressionRule
    * UnnecessaryIfStatementRule
    * UnnecessaryTernaryExpressionRule

OTHER CHANGES
- CodeNarc now requires Groovy 1.7 to run. Keep in mind that it can still run against (analyze) older Groovy code.
- There is a new rule set (category) called "dry", meaning "do not repeat yourself".
- There is a new "unnecessary" rule set (category).
- AstUtil enhancements - For writers of rules: there are new utility methods in the AstUtil class. See the javadoc for more details.

Changes in version 0.10 (26 September 2010)
-------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES
- Fix Bug #3071531: "Unused rules don't recognized method closures". https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=3071531&group_id=250145. e.g. private def bar() { }  .. return this.&bar;
- Fix: UnusedPrivateField: Don't produce violation if field is a Closure field and is executed.
- Fix: ImportFromSamePackage: Fix for (ignore) alias imports within same package.   package org.xyz;  import org.xyz.MyBigClass as MBC.
NEW RULES
- New UnnecessaryIfStatementRule (basic):  Checks for if statements where the if and else blocks are only returning true and false constants. if(x) { return true } else { return false }.
- New UnnecessaryBooleanExpressionRule (basic): Check for unnecessary boolean expressions, including ANDing (&&) or ORing (||) with true, false, null, or Map/List/String/Number literal. Also checks for negation of true, false, null, or Map/List/String/Number literal.
- New BigDecimalInstantiationRule (basic): Avoid creating BigDecimal with a decimal (float/double) literal. Use a String literal. From PMD. See http://pmd.sourceforge.net/rules/basic.html#AvoidDecimalLiteralsInBigDecimalConstructor. Note that println new BigDecimal(0.1) prints out 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.
- UnusedObjectRule (unused): Checks for object allocations that are not assigned or used, unless it is the last statement within a block (because it may be the intentional return value).
- New UnusedArrayRule (unused): This inspection reports any instances of Groovy array allocation where the array allocated is ignored. Such allocation expressions are legal Groovy, but are usually either inadvertent, or evidence of a very odd object initialization strategy. (IntelliJ). When an ExpressionStatement has as its expression an ArrayExpression.
- Implement ImplementationAsTypeRule (design): Checks that particular classes are never used as types in variable declarations, return values or parameters. GregorianCalendar, HashMap, HashSet, Hashtable, LinkedList, LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, TreeMap, Vector, ArrayList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet, ConcurrentHashMap, ArrayBlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, DelayQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue, PriorityQueue, SynchronousQueue (see Checkstyle). (design)
- New JUnitUnnecessaryTearDownRule (junit). Checks for tearDown() methods that only call super.tearDown().
- New JUnitUnnecessarySetUpRule (junit). Checks for setUp() methods that only call super.setUp().
NEW REPORT WRITER
- New InlineXmlReportWriter (from Robin Bramley) for improved integration with the Hudson Violations plugin. See http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations.   
OTHER CHANGES
- CodeNarc now requires Groovy 1.6 to run. Keep in mind that it can still run against (analyze) older Groovy code.
- Upgrade to GMetrics 0.3 for AbcComplexityRule and CyclomaticComplexityRule. Violations now include line number and source line.
- All JUnit rules (JUnit*Rule): Also apply to classes with names ending in *TestCase.
- Add codenarc create-rule script to create a new rule and associated classes/tests. https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3005873&group_id=250145&atid=1126575. (Hamlet D'Arcy)
- ConstantTernaryExpressionRule: Also flag constant Map and List expressions.
- ConstantIfExpressionRule: Also flag constant Map and List expressions.
- GrailsPublicControllerMethod: add ignoreMethodNames property.
- Add reference to Sonar plugin. http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Groovy+Plugin to web site.
- Add reference to Hudson Violations Plugin. http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations to web site.


Changes in version 0.9 (10 May 2010)
------------------------------------
BUG FIXES
- Fix bug #2985592: "MissingPropertyException: No such property: W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI".
- XML RuleSet: Allow wildcards (*) in <include> and <exclude>.
- WildcardPattern: Escape plus sign ('+').
- NestedBlockDepthRule: Ignore first level of closure for Closure Fields (since they are really equivalent to methods).
NEW SIZE/COMPLEXITY RULES
- AbcComplexityRule - Check ABC size/complexity score against threshold for method and class average (size)
- CyclomaticComplexityRule - Check Cyclomatic Complexity against threshold for method and class average (size)
NEW CONCURRENCY RULES
- NestedSynchronizationRule (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy)
- RunFinalizersOnExitRule (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy)
- SynchronizedMethodRule (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy) 
- SynchronizedOnThisRule (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy)
- ThreadLocalNotStaticFinalRule (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy)
- ThreadYieldRule: (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy)
- VolatileLongOrDoubleFieldRule: (concurrency - Hamlet D�Arcy)
NEW BASIC RULES
- CloneableWithoutCloneRule (basic - Hamlet D'Arcy & Ren� Gr�schke)
- ConstantIfExpressionRule: if(true) or if(false). Or literal constant. (basic)

- UnnecessaryTernaryExpressionRule: x ? true : false. Or Boolean.TRUE. Or where both expressions are the same. (basic)
OTHER CHANGES
- Deprecate GrailsSessionReferenceRule. Default enabled to false. Note in online docs.
- StatelessClassRule: Add setAddToIgnoreFieldNames() method (adds to ignoreFieldNames).
- Add new <rule>.description.html property for each rule. Change the HtmlReportWriter to look for *.description.html first; if not defined, use *.description. Continue to use *.description in XML report. Potential BREAKAGE: If you have overridden the "<rule>.description" message for a predefined rule in a "codenarc-messages.properties" file, you will have to change those message keys to "<rule>.description.html".
- Do not include disabled rules in list of rules at bottom of HTML/XML report.
- HtmlReportWriter: Don�t log warning if "codenarc-messages.properties" contains *.description but not *.description.html.
- UnusedVariableRule: Fix limitation: Does not recognize variable references on the same line as the variable declaration.
- GroovyDslRuleSet: Throw MissingPropertyException if a non-existent property is set within a Groovy RuleSet DSL.
- CodeNarcRunner: Add System.out println of summary counts.
- MethodSizeRule: Apply to constructors as well.
- WildcardPattern: Trim pattern values. This includes property values such as common rule properties applyToFileNames/doNotApplyToFileNames, applyToClassNames/doNotApplyToClassNames. Or many rule-specific properties such as ignoreMethodNames for the MethodSizeRule.
- PropertiesFileRuleSetConfigurer: Log warning if rule name not found.
- TESTS: AbstractRuleTestCase: Add assertViolations(String source, Map[] violationMaps) helper method.
- TESTS: Fix tests broken on Linux.


Changes in version 0.8.1 (2 Feb 2010)
------------------------------------
BUG FIXES
- Fix Bug #2943025: "NestedBlockDepthRule: Produces erroneous results on Groovy 1.6.x." https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2943025&group_id=250145&atid=1126573
- Fix Bug #2943028: "PackageNameRule may show incorrect violations for classes within the default package when running in Groovy 1.6.x." https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2943028&group_id=250145&atid=1126573
- Fix Bug #2935587 "Building CodeNarc 0.8 fails." - Problem from Joern Huxhorn (Jan 18, 2010) � Unable to build from the downloaded CodeNarc-0.8-bin.tar.gz.  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2935587&group_id=250145&atid=1126573. See CodeNarc - Unable to Build From TarGZip.doc. Remove platform/locale dependencies: AbstractReportWriterTest, UrlResourceTest, GrailsSessionReferenceRuleTest, GrailsPublicControllerMethodRuleTest, GrailsServletContextReferenceRuleTest, GrailsStatelessServiceRuleTest. [Jan 24]
- Fix StackOverflow in Groovy 1.7.0 for some rules: All rules that implement the visitVariableExpression(VariableExpression expression) visitor method: UnusedVariableRule, UnusedPrivateFieldRule, GrailsSessionReferenceRule, GrailsServletContextReferenceRule � Removed call to super.visitVariableExpression(expression) since that seems to cause problems (StackOverflow) in Groovy 1.7.0.
- Fix tests broken when running in Groovy 1.6 or Groovy 1.7.
- DuplicateImportRule: Document that this rule does not work when running under Groovy 1.7 (i.e., will not produce any violations), and does not distinguish between multiple duplicate imports for the same class.


Changes in version 0.8 (17 Jan 2010)
------------------------------------
BUG FIXES
- Fix Bug #2930886: "Cannot load rules when groovy is in different classloader".  XmlReaderRuleSet, ReportWriterFactory: Replace calls to Class.forName() with getClass().classLoader.loadClass(). https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=2930886&group_id=250145.
- Fix Bug #2847520: "UnusedVariableRule: Closure variable must be invoked". UnusedVariableRule: Referencing an (explicit) Closure variable without invoking it is not recognized as a valid reference. e.g., final CLOSURE = { .. }; return CLOSURE. https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2847520&group_id=250145&atid=1126573
- Fix false positive: Local closures: If a closure is assigned to a local variable, then used later in the method, CodeNarc report the variable unused. [I think this has already been resolved, perhaps as part of Bug #2847520]. (reported by Donal Murtagh)
- Fix false positive: Default arguments: If a constant is only used as the value of a default argument, CodeNarc reports this constant unused. (reported by Donal Murtagh)
REPORTS

BUG FIXES
- Fix BUG #2798845 : "StringIndexOutOfBoundsException" https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=2798845&group_id=250145
- Fix BUG #2799752: GrailsPublicControllerMethodRule - should only apply itself to methods within classes that have suffix "Controller". (see email from Jason Anderson, May 26, 2009) https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2799752&group_id=250145&atid=1126573
- Fix BUG #2796953: StatelessClassRule requires applyToFileNames or applyToFilesMatching.  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126573&aid=2796953&group_id=250145
- Fix BUG #2811213: "FieldNameRule: Names for final fields - not be all caps". FieldNameRule: Field names for final instance fields should not default to be all caps like static final fields. For instance: final List sentEmails = []. Rather, "If a property is declared final the private field is created final and no setter is generated." (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Beans). So, they should be named with "normal" naming conventions. Re-purpose the finalRegex property to just apply to final instance fields and default to null so that final field names use same convention as non-final. https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2811213&group_id=250145&atid=1126573.
- Fix: GrailsStatelessServiceRule: Should only apply to *Service classes.
